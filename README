This is libtprof, a library for profiling applications on GNU/Linux systems.

If you're looking at libtprof, you probably came here by this path:

    * You've tried gcov but wanted more information than just line counts.
    * You tried gprof but realized it wouldn't profile shared libraries, where
      a big chunk (or all) of your code lives.
    * You attempted to use sprof but got a cryptic error message about PLTRELs
      that you didn't understand.

libtprof is the solution.  You can profile anything with it -- application,
shared library, VisIt, your toaster if it runs Linux.  No source code
modifications are required.  Your code runs significantly faster than under
valgrind.  You can probably get meaningful results out of it in a half hour.

As a quick start:
    1) install libtprof
    2) recompile your application (or portions thereof) with the gcc option
       `-finstrument-functions', and link against libtprof.
    3) run your application.
